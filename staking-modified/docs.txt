Initial staking contract was modified.
1. Possibility to set arbitrary erc20 token for yield added.
2. Workaround for fixing LP tokens rate volatility (to avoid changing of yield amount when LP token rate is changed)
3. Possibility to upgrade and downgrade vaults (downgrade with tax)


Using market indexes for treating LP rate volatility works fine. The only thing that should be taken into account - when using marketing indexes interest is compound. If the APR for LP vault will be 100% after year of deposit users will get yield = ~1.7 * initialAmount instead of 1 * initialAmount for simple interest
