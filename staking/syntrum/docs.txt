Initial staking contract was modified.
1. Possibility to set arbitrary erc20 token for yield added.
2. Workaround for fixing LP tokens rate volatility (to avoid changing of yield amount when LP token rate is changed)
3. Possibility to upgrade and downgrade vaults (downgrade with tax)


Using market indexes for treating LP rate volatility works fine. The only thing that should be taken into account - when using marketing indexes interest is compound. If the APR for LP vault will be 100% after year of deposit users will get yield = ~1.7 * initialAmount instead of 1 * initialAmount for simple interest

1. User can stake in erc20 tokens.
2. It is possible to set yield in arbitrary erc20 token.
3. It is possible to change apr
4. It is possible to create few deposit profiles with same staking token and yield token and let user upgrade or downgrade. It is possible to set tax for downgrade.
5. It is possible to re-stake yield if staking and yield in the same token.
6. It is possible to set lockup period for token staking when user can not unstake.
7. It is possible to set period and withdraw tax when user should pay taxt for yield withdraw
